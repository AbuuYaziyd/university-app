URL would be:
http://localhost/university-app

5. If the application is installed into another folder, change the path on the
following file */app/config.php, line 2*
```php
define( 'BASE_URL', '/university-app/');  //WEB directory, external path url
```

```

7. Make
```
composer install

##Technical notes
-----------------

The framework used in this project was created from scratch, thinking on an easy and fast development. 

It implements a system based on a data model, where you define basically all
the fields that the model needs and its relationships with other tables or entities.
So, the system can validate data automatically, for example:

```php
$this->field('id', 				'integer', ['PK'=>true, 'validate'=>false] );
$this->field('student_id', 		'integer', ['FK'=>true]);
$this->field('course_id', 		'integer', ['FK'=>true]);
$this->field('level', 			'integer');
$this->field('date_of_creation','date', [ 'validate'=>false,
                                          'required'=>false, 
                                          'default'=>date('Y-m-d') ] );
```

Here you can see the entity *registrations* and its fields and relationships with
other tables, like *Student* and *Course*.

These relationships make it easier to obtain information from foreign tables:
```php
//Load object Registration
$obj_registration = new Registration($id);
//Binding with Students tabla
echo "The name of the students is: " . $obj_registration->getStudent()->name;
echo "And he courses " . $obj_registration->getCourse()->name;
```
